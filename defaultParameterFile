#Lines with no = will also be skipped
#Format is "label=value" on each line
#Attempts to set parameters not defined in the code will cause code execution to halt

#Number of agents to create
nAgents=60

#Number of steps to run for
nSteps=10

#number of OMP threads to use. Increase the number here if using openmp to parallelise any loops.
#Note number of threads needs to be <= to number of cores/threads supported on the local machine
nThreads=1

#random seed - change to vary the stochastic parts of the model
#runs with the same seed should produce the same output...although maybe not if nThreads>1
